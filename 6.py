# FIRST CLASS EX.

# A:
first = 7
second = 44.3

print(first + second)
print(first * second)
print(second / first)

# B:
a = 9
b = 8
c = 15

# C:
name = "john"
name = 'john'
# no difference, except now we can insert one of them into a string that uses the opposite chupchiks

my_number = 5+5
print("result is: "+str(my_number))

# D:
# output will be 7
x = 5
y = 2.36
print(x + int(y))

# CHALLENGE
a = 8
b = "123"
print(a + int(b))  # idk if this is considered not changing the var ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
